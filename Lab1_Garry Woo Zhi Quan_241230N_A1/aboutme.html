            I was born in Alvernia hospital at around 9 am, being born to 2 loving parents. I crawled at 4 months,
             and took my first steps at 7 months. I said my first word which was "Mama" at 11 months old, and for
              the remainder of time when i adressed my parents as a baby would, I only said Daddy afterwords

            I was very scared, and my fear was justified, in primary school, i was bullied constantly. 
            But despite this, even though i was bullied in primary school, i pushed on in secondary school,
             and in secondary school, i built my character to be a better man than i was, causing me to make more friends, and to meet my bro for life.
