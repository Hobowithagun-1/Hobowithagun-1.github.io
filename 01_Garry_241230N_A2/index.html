                a total of 17 million died as a result of this war, about 7 million of which are civilian deaths.

        <article class="Text_Right">
            The Great War began on June 28, 1914, with the assassinations of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and
            his
            wife,
            Sophie, while they were visiting Sarajevo,
            Bosnia, a country recently annexed into the Austrian Empire. Many Bosnians and their Serbian neighbors
            resented
            this foreign rule and the Archduke's visit to Sarajevo provided
            the opportunity for a small band of Serbian dissidents to strike back.

        <article class="Text_Left">
            Austria responded to the assassinations by teaming up with its ally, Germany, and declaring war on
            Serbia.
            The
            conflict soon involved Russia, France and Belgium. Fearful of a full-scale world war
            that would threaten its sea routes to other countries, Great Britain joined the fight against Germany
            and
            Austria.

            Germany surrendered in 1918, with the leaders of the German army telling the German government to end the
            fighting, the government asked the US for an armistice, which
            is an agreement to end the fighting. So at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the
            Great
            War officially ended.

            Trenches became a favoured tactic with both sides, but it is usually associated with the Germans, due to
            each side having a high reliance on Artillery.
            Trenches were a necassity as it gave troops a way to protect themselves from the shockwaves of artillery
            fire.

            Artillery was most commonly used on the Western front, raining down high-explosive shells, shrapnel and
            poison gas on the enemy. This artilley would not only
            be very lethal, but it would also make the enemy's moral drop.

        <article class="Text_Right" id="Creeping_Barrage">
            A tactic used was called <b>Creeping barrage</b>, where a line of infantry would be moving behind a line of
            artillery fire. This line would usually move about 50 to
            100 yards every few minutes moving forward slowly. If done correctly, this is a very devastating stratergy,
            as it would force enemies back to their trenches while
            the infantry behind the artilley fire can catch the enemies by surprise.

        <article>
            Unfortunately, this tactic is usually very difficult to pull off, as the artillery from the back has to be
            in <b>Perfect</b> unison with
            the infantry in the front. Most of the time, it ends up with either the artillery moving to slowly, causing
            the artillery fire to land on their
            own troops, or the infantry moves too fast, resulting in them getting caught in their own infantry.
